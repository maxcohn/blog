title: Goodbyes Can Be Nice
---

Today I wrapped up my last lab in my Imaging Science class. It's a relatively
easy course for non-majors to get their science credits fulfilled. As part of the
course requirement, there is a lab.

I went into lab with 2 people I had kind of known for the past year, and we were
going to need 2 more members. We walked into a lab room on the first day, and 2
other people joined our group. Groups were not assigned for the entire semester,
but no one really wanted to bother changing groups (if it isn't broken, don't bother
fixing it).

There was always a bit of downtime in the labs, which of course leads to off
topic conversation. It was nice to have a conversation with a group of people that
I didn't really know 10 weeks ago. We never got very close or made plans outside
of our scheduled lab time, or even sit together in lecture.

The end of our last lab today was just as anyone would expect. We got up and left.
I said goodbye to the two people I knew prior to lab, as they still had to pack
up their belongings, and I left with the two people I hadn't known prior. We left
the building, not talking much except for a comment or two. As we left the building,
we all when separate ways, saying our goodbyes.

It was really nice.

I know it probably seems weird to reflect on something so insignificant, but it
was really nice to have completed a small part of our lives, and be able to move
on separately, with no need to stay in touch. We all will experience many temporary
relationships in our lives, from jobs we worked briefly, hobbies we grew out of,
to any time we had to leave some sort of community, whether it be big or small.

I've experienced this multiple times through part time jobs I had in high school
and internships I've had. Being able to connect with people with an understanding
that this just a passing part of each other's lives is really refreshing. We get
to learn from new people and experience new things, but eventually, these parts
of our lives end. I don't think these have to be sad endings, but instead should
be looked at as a tied bow on the gift of new experiences. A nice concrete ending
is satisfying.

These parts of our lives vary in significance of course. My time on my first
summer internship and the people I met there will have a much longer lasting
affect on me than my lab group that met for only a handful of hours, but none the
less, they are nice.

There is nothing that makes a relationship necessarily temporary either. If we
have a connection with a group or individual, we can make sure to keep the
relationship alive. This is especially easy with the internet and our ease of
access to communication we have today.

That being said, some goodbyes are sad, particularly with those that are more
significant in our lives. Some goodbyes are for short amounts of time, maybe one
summer, but others are longer. Some goodbyes are permanent, but we may not know
that at the time.

It's ok to have sad goodbyes, but we should appreciate the goodbyes at we have
that serve as a bookend to a part of our lives, whether that part be big or small.
