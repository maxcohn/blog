# Addresses to update when you move

I've moved way too many times and each time I do, I dread having to update my address for every service that requires it.
I'm making myself a list so I don't forget for next time, and maybe someone else can use it too.
This list is focused on the United States.

- [ ] Driver's License/DMV
	* This is often connected to everything to do with voting, at least in my experience
- [ ] Bank accounts and credit cards
- [ ] Online retail (Amazon, Ebay)
	* I don't think this is a big deal to update except for your big services.
	Updates for these can happen whenever you next use them as well.
- [ ] Brokerage accounts
	* This includes your 401k and any other accounts you may have.
	Common brokerage firms include Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity.
- [ ] HRIS system and employer
	* An HRIS system is how your employer may manage payroll and other employment documents.
	There's a good chance you can update this completely within your HRIS system, but I'd also mention it to your HR.
- [ ] USPS mail forwarding
	* This is kind of a catch-all that can make sure anything critical ends up getting to you as well.

I'll be updating this page as I find new categories of things.
